* A computer with an operating system of any kind (preferably Linux)
* If you only have Windows, PuTTY keygen, and PuTTY client
* A Google Cloud Platform VM Instance

#s
1. Create an ssh-rsa key with ssh-keygen on Linux, or PuTTY keygen on Windows
2. Copy the contents of your .pub keyfile (your public key), or those of the public keyfile generated with PuTTY keygen, to VM Instances > Metadata > SSH keys > Add Key > Add Key > Text field. The keys should start with ssh-rsa.
3. On Linux, open a terminal instance, and enter: `ssh [username]@[domain or external IP] -p 22`
4. You should be instantly taken to the account's TTY terminal.
5. That's all!
