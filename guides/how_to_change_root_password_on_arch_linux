How to change the root password on Arch Linux from a live image

#b

#n
* An Arch Linux machine with a (lost) root password (which is locking you out, and) you want to change
* A live image of Arch Linux, or an Arch Linux based distro with terminal access (e.g. Antergos)
* Will to perform something

#s
1. Stick the flash drive or DVD into your drive or port.
2. Bring up the boot menu (F12 for everything I've ever used).
3. Select your live drive *badum-tss*.
4. Start the live session.
5. Find the terminal (with an original Arch image, you should boot right into the tty. With e.g. Antergos, you have to click the terminal icon in the top left of Cnchi).
6. Use the command `lsblk` to list your drives, and choose the one which your Arch(-based) distro is on.
7. Mount this drive to the /mnt dir by using the command `mount /dev/[your sd drive] /mnt` (for example: `mount /dev/sda1 /mnt`, in which case sda1 is the Arch partition).
8. Use the command `(sudo) arch-chroot /mnt`. You should be rooted right into the partition.
9. Type `passwd`
10. Follow the prompt.
11. Reboot your machine, and login as root on the Arch distro.
12. BONUS STEPS: If you have other accounts you need the password changed of, just type `(sudo) su [username of the account]`. Then follow the guide from step nine to step ten.
13. You should be able to login to this account as well now.
All set!
